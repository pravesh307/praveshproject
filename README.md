This project is an Android application for NIT3213 Assignment that integrates with an API for authentication and displays a list of entities with details.

## Features

- **Login Functionality**: Users can log in using a username and password, which fetches a `keypass` from the API.
- **Dashboard**: After a successful login, the app displays a list of entities retrieved from the API.
- **Details Page**: Clicking on an entity in the dashboard shows its details.
- **Profile Icon**: The dashboard includes a profile image next to each entity.
- **Unit Testing**: Simple tests are included for login validation and API interactions.

## API Endpoints

The app interacts with the following API endpoints:

1. **Login Endpoint** (`/footscray/auth`): Accepts a username and password, returning a `keypass`.
2. **Dashboard Endpoint** (`/dashboard/{keypass}`): Fetches a list of entities using the `keypass`.
